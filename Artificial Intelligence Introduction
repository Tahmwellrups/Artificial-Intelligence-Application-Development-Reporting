INTRODUCTION

Imagine a world where we can do our daily tasks without even giving too much effort. Learning new knowledge by asking your devices. Make everything automatic. That sounded like a Sci-Fi movie plot that can have a conflict of technology taking over humanity. This might be a futuristic dream back in the day, but in our present time, this dream became a reality. The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) made the automation of modern technology possible, it became the future of technology and a new tool for humanity. Although automation has existed for many decades, the rise of AI made automation similar to that of humans. This is how revolutionary AI is in our modern world. But do we know enough about it? To what extent can we use them? Are they even safe for humanity to use in the future? We will uncover these questions in this paper.

AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to mimic cognitive functions such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. It encompasses a wide range of techniques, algorithms, and methodologies that enable machines to exhibit intelligent behaviour. AI has become increasingly important in today's world, with applications ranging from self-driving cars and virtual assistants to fraud detection and medical diagnosis. As technology continues to advance, AI is expected to play an even greater role in our lives, transforming the way we work, communicate, and interact with the world around us. But as we use this technology in our world, the more we need to be responsible. We must learn to adapt these things in our everyday lives with responsible use, else, it will cause harmful effects on our world.
